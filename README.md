# News-Data-Analysis-
Data was collected over 10 years from 2012 to 2022 on different category. 
Sentiment Analysis was done on each category for every year. 
Shift of the sentiment on a category for 10 years was checked and analysed by plotting line chart. 
Six categories were analysed namely :- Entertainment, Comedy, Travel, Sports, Business, Crime. 
Except Comedy the sentiment on all the other categories has declined. 
It looks like people are more moved towards comedy shows or other fun activites to keep up the mental health during the covid and lockdown time. 
Travel category was declining but looks like after 2020 there was a boost in the travel industry or the travelling mentality took a positive growth. The lockdown period might have given a positive impact.
